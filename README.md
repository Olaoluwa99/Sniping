A simple Android library that provides a floating button to launch a sniping tool on Android phones.

## Features

- Easily add a floating snipe button to your Android app.
- Capture screenshots or screen recordings with a single tap.
- Highly customizable appearance and behavior of the button.

## Installation

To use this library in your Android project, follow these steps:

### Gradle

Add the following dependency to your app module's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.example:library:1.0.0'
```

Replace `com.example:library:1.0.0` with the actual dependency information once you release the library.

### Maven

You can also use Maven by adding the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>library</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

1. In your Android layout XML, add the `SnipeButton` view:

```xml
<com.example.library.SnipeButton
    android:id="@+id/snipe_button"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_gravity="bottom|end" />
```

2. In your activity or fragment, initialize and configure the button:

```java
SnipeButton snipeButton = findViewById(R.id.snipe_button);

// Customize the button appearance and behavior here
```

3. Implement the click listener to launch the sniping tool:

```java
snipeButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        // Launch the sniping tool here
    }
});
```
